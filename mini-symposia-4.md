#### S. Marras and Y. Tissaoui

**Abstract:**

*The dawn of exascale computing presents unprecedented opportunities for advancing the fidelity and scope of atmosphere and ocean models. This minisymposium is meant to convene experts in high-performance computing and Earth system science to explore strategies for maximizing the potential of these powerful architectures. We will delve into cutting-edge techniques for parallelization, data management, and I/O optimization specifically tailored for complex climate and weather simulations. Presentations will highlight novel algorithmic developments, efficient utilization of heterogeneous architectures (CPUs, GPUs), and experiences porting and scaling models to exascale platforms. Contributions about both classical numerical approaches and hybrid-AI techniques are welcome. A key focus will be on addressing the unique challenges posed by the immense data volumes and computational demands of next-generation atmospheric and oceanic modeling systems. Join us to discuss the path forward in unlocking the full predictive capability of our planet through exascale innovation.*
