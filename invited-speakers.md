He received his PhD from RWTH Aachen University in 2017. Until 2022, he was a postdoctoral researcher at RWTH Aachen, Jülich Aachen Research Alliance, and California Institute of Technology. Lennart is currently a developer of the multiphysics CFD software Simcenter STAR-CCM+. His research interests lie in numerical method development, turbulent multiphase flow, and high-performance computing.</p><p><strong>Title of Lennart&#x27;s keynote lecture:</strong> <em>The intricacies of adaptive unstructured mesh refinement for industrial flows</em><br/><br/><strong>Abstract:</strong><br/><em>The simulation of industrial flows is associated with significant uncertainties arising from the quality of the computational mesh. In many industries, meshing therefore is considered an expert job. With the advances in parallel computing and GPU hardware reducing solver times, meshing can become a bottleneck in certain industrial workflows. While adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is an intriguing approach to alleviate some of those problems, developing such a technique in a robust form is a challenge in its own.<br/><br/>In this talk, the intricacies of developing a general purpose AMR scheme are discussed. This includes the definition of generic solution-based refinement strategies. And it will be demonstrated that refining an unstructured mesh does not automatically guarantee lower truncation errors, but can even lead to the opposite.</em></p><div class="block separator"></div>
