**Title of Möller's keynote lecture:** *Quantum lattice Boltzmann methods*

**Abstract:**

<p class="has-text-justified">
    <em>Quantum computing (QC) is an emerging compute technology that has the potential to radically change the way we will be solving CFD problems in the future. The potential power of QC stems from the exploitation of quantum mechanical principles, namely, superposition of states, entanglement and quantum parallelism. With properly designed quantum algorithms that fully exploit these properties it will be possible to solve certain types of computational problems up to exponentially faster or with exponentially less memory storage compared to classical counterparts. However, this requires the complete redesign of the solution procedure from scratch rather than a simple "porting" of classical algorithms to quantum computers.</em>

    <em>In this presentation, I will discuss the current state of the art of quantum lattice Boltzmann methods (QLBM). In particular, I will present different approaches to store ("encode") grid data efficiently in the quantum register and perform the computational steps of the LBM - streaming, collision, and boundary treatment - as efficiently executable quantum circuits. The main challenge lies in designing the data encoding scheme and the quantum circuits in a way that exploits quantum mechanical principles, delivers (at least theoretically) a speed up over classical LBM, and is implementable on (future) quantum computers. The next challenge lies in the efficient extraction of meaningful information via measurement, which is the only way to read out data from a quantum computer. Since the measurement-based read-out of full flow fields is very inefficient, we have developed a quantum variant of the widely-used momentum exchange method (MEM) that calculates the forces acting on objects from which user-defined quantities of interest like the drag or lift coefficient can be calculated in a post processing step.</em>

<p class="has-text-justified">
    <em>Next to discussing the algorithmic building blocks of quantum lattice Boltzmann methods from a conceptual perspective, I will present an end-to-end quantum LBM application and first numerical results in 2D and 3D obtained with our open-source QLBM software on quantum computer simulators.</em>

## Christian Hasse - Technical University Darmstadt, Simulation of reactive Thermo-Fluid Systems

Christian Hasse is full professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Darmstadt University of Technology. He holds the chair of Simulation of reactive Thermo-Fluid Systems. He has supervised successfully more than 30 PhD students and currently 25 PhD students and post-docs are working in his group. He has more than 270 peer-reviewed publications and has served in multiple editorial boards and as associate/guest editor. He is organizer of scientific workshops and conferences focusing on sustainable combustion to achieve net zero emissions.

Prof. Hasse is elected Fellow of the Combustion Institute for his contributions on turbulent combustion, solid fuel combustion, multi-phase flow and soot formation. He has been elected to the Board of Directors of the International Combustion Institute in 2024. His main research interests are modeling and high-fidelity simulation of reactive and non-reactive flows, especially for CO2-free and CO2-neutral fuels such as hydrogen, ammonia, biomass, E-fuels and metals. In addition to fundamental studies on flame structures and dynamics, he also actively works on transferring these results to real-world applications including (aero-)engines, boilers and processes chemical engineering. For these topics, his group has developed a number of high-fidelity software applications that are deployed national Tier-2 and European Tier-0/1 supercomputers. In 2024 he has received an ERC Advanced Grant on aluminum steam combustion in which he aims to unravel the fundamental properties of pressurized Al-steam flames for the entire scientific chain, from single particles to turbulent flames with millions of particles, through a well-orchestrated combination of high-fidelity simulations, advanced modeling, and tailored experiments.

**Title of Christian&#x27;s keynote lecture:** *How high-fidelity simulations of hydrogen combustion on supercomputers accelerate the energy transition.*

**Abstract:**

*Reactive Computational Fluid Dynamics (rCFD) has become an indispensable tool in fundamental and applied research. In addition, rCFD is used in industrial design, such as aero engine combustors or gas turbines. This success is based on the combination of decades of scientific model development, efficient numerics and ever-increasing computing power. This situation is about to change as both the energy system (1) and the HPC architecture (2) are undergoing disruptive changes.*

*First, the urgent need to shift from fossil fuels to renewable fuels such as hydrogen requires the redesign of energy conversion systems due to the completely different combustion characteristics of renewable fuels. Combustion models for high-fidelity simulations are lacking and must be developed based on in-depth physical understanding. Second, the next generation of supercomputers will be mostly based on GPUs rather than CPUs. Efficient use of these systems will require a new class of CFD software with specialized numerics.*

*In this talk I will first introduce the role of rCFD in combustion system design before I highlight the role of hydrogen in the energy transition and how it differs from conventional fuels. After discussing the impact of GPU-based supercomputers on rCFD software development, I will present how GPU-based direct numerical simulations can unravel the complexities of hydrogen combustion.*

*In summary, in a rapidly changing environment, simulations on upcoming Exascale systems will provide physical insights that were deemed impossible just a few years ago. This will increase the impact of rCFD on the entire spectrum from fundamental science to industrial design of innovative systems.*
